## hello, i'm anne üëã‚ôø
i'm an indian high school senior, a girls-in-tech club leader and a hack clubber who is somewhat new to the world of tech. i organized counterspell delhi in november 2024 and regularly host workshops for different hack club events. i'm a girls-who-code + kode-with-klossy alumni interested in cybersecurity, cognitive science and criminal law.

i code (and spend 100 hours debugging), do design stuff and tinker around with hardware components and pcbs. i recently transitioned to linux, am learning how to produce my own music with ableton and preparing for the comptia sec+ certificate. i do different ysws's, build fun projects (for arcade/highseas) and participate in #100daysofcode. most of my repos are private (because i need to work more on them) but i love open source i promise.
