## hello, i'm anne 👋♿
```
HI REVIEWER/HCB TEAM IM HOPING UR HAVING AN AWESOME DAY !! <br>
im currently (as of 08/28) planning out a project with an rpi but i'm so sad because i'll only be able to get the pieces all <br>
together after aracde ends. like i really like this silly little documentation process and in 10 years i can look back at what <br>
all i built and the hours i put into something like it's some sort of career time capsule (if that makes sense?). ok ykw im also so <br>
sad that i'll only be able to finish my sprig + blot + onboard + bin (+ potentially cider) after arcade is long over <br>
because the interconnected yet independent nature of these events are so cool (everyone say thank you zach). <br>
sorry for getting emotional on main tho, it will happen again :/
